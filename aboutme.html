        <h1> About Me </h1>         
        
        <p> Hello! My name is Aaron Qureshi. I'm striving to learn more about computer science towards pursuing a career in cyber security. I've been building computers since I was 15 and have always been curious as to how the internal proceses of websites, computers, and software are created. I hope to fill this online portfolio full of work I am proud to have made.</p>
