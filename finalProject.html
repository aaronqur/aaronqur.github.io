        <h1 textalight=center> Welcome to my Portfolio! </h1>               
        <h2> Welcome to Aaron Qureshi's and Nolan Fletcher's Black Jack program. This program features a 2 player betting mechanic. Bets must be placed before starting each round. Maximum funds = 100. To place a bet, first player clicks the chips on the bottom left of the screen to select an amount, then presses "place bet" to allow second player to bet. After both players have placed their bets, press "Play" to begin playing Black Jack. Press "Hit" to to gain a card, "Stay" to move on to the next player or end the game, or "Restart" after a bust. The first player to go bankrupt loses!</h2>
